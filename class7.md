# Programming with JavaScript

## Control Flow

-Control Flow: is the order that the computer runs statements in a script
-In what order does code run
    . It typtically starts to runs from the first line to the last line (unless in conditionals and loops)
-An example of a conditional structure in which the user doesn't fill out a required field:
   *if (field==empty) {
     promptUser();
    } else {
    submitForm();
    }
-"Control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code."
-Control flow means when reading a script not only to read from start to finish but also need to see program structure and the way it affects order of execution

## JavaScript Functions

-A JavaScript function is "a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
-A JavaScript function executes when "something" calls it.
-Example of a JavaScript function:
    *function myFunction(p1, p2) {
return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2
    }

## JavaScript Syntax

-A JavaScript function syntax: "function" keyword then the name of the function, followed by parentheses()
-The name of the function can contain: numbers, letters, underscores and $ (same for variables)
-"The parentheses can include parameter names separated by commas : (parameter1,parameter2,...)"
-"The code to be executed, by the function is placed inside curly brackets:{}
