## Notes

- **Big o** - used to describe how efficienct a function or an algorithm is. We evaluate the efficiency based on 1. Running time & 2. Memory space

- The areas we look into when analazing the limiting factors we

1. Input size
2. Units of measuerment
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best case, Worst case, and Average case

### Linked List-

- Is a sequence of Nodes connected to one another.
- There are two types of Linked List

1. Singly
2. Doubly

- What is a **Singly** linked list? It means ther is one reference and it points to the next node within that linked list
- What is a **Doubly** linked list? It means there are two references in the node. The references are ***Next*** and ***Previous***
-What is a **Node** Nodes are items or links that live whithin a linked list.
-What is a **Next**?  Every node has a property called Next, it contains the reference to the next node
