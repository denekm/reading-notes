## Notes

- **Big o** - used to describe how efficienct a function or an algorithm is. We evaluate the efficiency based on 1. Running time & 2. Memory space

- The areas we look into when analazing the limiting factors we

1. Input size
2. Units of measuerment
3. Orders of Growth
4. Best case, Worst case, and Average case
