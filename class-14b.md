# What Google Learned About Teams

- "More than three-quarters of an employee's day is spent communicating with colleagues over the last two decades"
- Based on studies:
  1. Groups seem to innovate faster,
  2. We notice mistakes faster,
  3. Find better solutions when working,
  4. Better results are achieved
- Top executives at Google believed it's better to combine the best people in teams.
- ***Project Aristotle** - was a  study at google which evaluated Google's teams in order to figure out why some teams stumbled and some soared
- Project Aristotle looked at different factors like if teams are better when they are made up of people with similar interests, or when everyone is working towards similar rewards, they also studied if gender played an impact on their success.
- Even though they looked at different factors and studied 180 teams from the company they were unable to find patterns.
- "Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function we gather"
- After studying over one hundred groups for more than a year, the project researchers came to the conclusion that understanding and influencing group norms were the key to improving the company's teams.
