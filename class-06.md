## Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming

- Problem domains are like puzzles that have a blurry picture or have no picture which is why they are difficult to identify.
- What makes problem domains difficult?
  1. We often will not be given full information of the problem domain(not enough infomation given to us.)

- If we understand the problem domain then programmming is easy.

- It is very crucial ot undersand the question when writting code.

- How can we make programming easier?
  1. By making the problem domain easy
  Do this by taking it one step out of time in order not to get overwhelmed.
