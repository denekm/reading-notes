# Operators & Loops

## Loops

' Loops allow us to do something repeatedly in a quick and easy manner.
' An example of a loop stating "to go five steps to the east"

    ' for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
' The different loop statments give different ways to ditermine the start and the end points of the loop.
' Statements for loops in JavaScript:
    1. for statment
    2. do...while statment
    3. while statment
    4. labeled statment
    5. break statment
    6. continue statment
    7. for...in statment
    8. for...of statment

## for statment

'for loop is repeated until a condition comes to being false
'An example of a for statment:
for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

' The steps that occur when a for loop executes:
    'If "initialExpression" "(if any), is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables."
    'The "conditionExpression" is first evaluated and if the value of the conditionExpression is true then the loop statments is executed. And if the value is false the for loop is terminated.
    'The "statment" executes. If you want to execute many statments, use: ({...}) to group the statments

## do...while statment

'This statment repeats until a condition evaluates to false.
' An example of a do...while statment
'let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1;
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 5)
' this do loop is repeated unit "i" is greater than five
