# Read: Class 01

## Notes

- In Java we store related types such ass classes, interfaces, annotations and enumerations in a **Package**
- In Java we can have two classes with the same name but the classes have to be in two different packages.
- Types of loops in Java:

1. ***for loop***
2. ***for each loop***
3. ***while loop***
4. ***do while loop***

## Questions

1.Which loops use a loop counter?

- For loop uses a loop counter

2.Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.

- ***.sort()*** - sorts the array in ascending order
- ***.equals()*** - returns true if two arrays are equal(have the same number of elements & values)
- ***.binarySearch()*** - searches for an object using binary search algorithm. Note- array must be sorted.

3.Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.

- When you rent an Airbnb the house comes with furniture and other commodities that you can use. Likewise, Java built in packages come with JDK that we can use.
