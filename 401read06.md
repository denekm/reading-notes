## Notes

## Inheritance

- ![Inheritance of Bike Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/java/concepts-bikeHierarchy.gif)

- In the example above we see that mountain bikes, road bikes, and tandem bikes all share the characteristics of a bike. And each bike also have additional features which make each different from one another.
- In the example above Bicycle is the **superclass** of ***MountainBike***, ***RoadBike***, and ***TandemBike***
- In Java each class can have one direct superclass.
- When creating a subclass in Java we use the key word **extends**

## Package

- Packages help us organize a set of related classes as well as interfaces.

## Questions

1.What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

- An object is an instance of a class, a class is a blueprint to creating an object.

2.What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

- Design patterns help us guarantee that a class only has one object

3.Static methods are also called what? Why?

- Static methods are also called class methods because a static method belongs to the class and not the object of a class. Example:

`class Test {`
  `// static method inside the Test class`
  `public static void method() {...}`
`}`

`class Main {`
  `// invoking the static method`
  `Test.method();`
`}`
