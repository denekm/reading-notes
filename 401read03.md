## Notes

## Java Primitives Versus Objects

- **Wrapper classes** are immutable
- **Autoboxing;** and ***unboxing**: when we convert a primitive type to a reference type it is called autoboxing. When we convert a reference to a primitive type it is called unboxing.
- Autoboxing example: ***Integer j = 2;***
- Unboxing example: int i = new Integer(1);

- Primitive types and their memory:

1. boolean – 1 bit
2. byte – 8 bits
3. short, char – 16 bits
4. int, float – 32 bits
5. long, double – 64 bits

- An exveption is when an error occurs so our code won't run
